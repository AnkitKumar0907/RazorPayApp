# 🌐 Razorpay Homepage Clone

A clean and responsive Razorpay homepage clone built using **Tailwind CSS**. This project replicates the visual design of the Razorpay homepage, demonstrating how utility-first CSS can be used to quickly create beautiful and scalable UIs.

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my **Razorpay Clone** project — a pixel-perfect recreation of the [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com) homepage using the power of **Tailwind CSS**.

This project was built to sharpen my frontend skills, dive deeper into responsive design, and explore how a real-world product landing page can be recreated using utility-first CSS. It's also a great way to demonstrate how fast and efficient Tailwind can be for building modern UIs.
